   - Must include a team roster
     - Everyone will include a picture of themselves, their name, and a short bio describing yourself.
- **Team Roles**
   - Each person took a turn saying what role within the project they would like to do.
   - Even though each person will have a role and that will be their main responsibily, everyone will be helping eachother throughout the course of the project.
