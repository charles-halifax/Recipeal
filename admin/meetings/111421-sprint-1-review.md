  - Tests run before it allows any code to change
  - Lu: Developers add more detail to github issues
- Style Sheet
  - Designers made a style sheet for desingers to reference when styling elements
  - There is also an HTML Template example that they made for a more concrete example
  - Yibo: Look more into absolute vs relative positioning
