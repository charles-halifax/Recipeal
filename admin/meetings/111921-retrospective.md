- Team Radar
  - Started with a work happiness radar survey as a warmup to get people thinking.
  - Overall, our team health is pretty good, with most scores in the 3.5-4 / 5 range
  - Need to work on:
    - Mastery (not something we can 100% fix right now)
    - Clarity
      - Touch on this in the main retrospective
- Start, Stop, Continue
  - Notable starts:
    - Full team codebase update meetings
      - Right now, only the devs are 'in the loop' with the codebase, no one else really understands how it works. 
    - A more defined structure to give out tasks
      - Clarity 
  - Notable stops:
    - Daily asynchronous slack standups
      - Some people not finding value in it
      - Can't get enough information from each other
  - Notable continues:
    - Using GitHub issues to keep track of our action items
      - Goes back to structured task assignment
    - Daily asynchronous slack standups
      - Some people like it as it acts like a "ToDo" & keeps them accountable
- Action items
  - Make the standups optional/Do them when you have something valuable to share
  - Dedicated updates slack channel for people to post more lengthy updates when they've completed a large task
    - Meant to foster more communication across role groups
  - Code/Development Meetings
    - Going to take the first 10/15 minutes of our weekly meetings to go over any new code updates so that way everyone is on the same page with how the codebase is functioning
