# Team 13 Stand-Up Meeting

## Structure

3. What issues are blocking me?

## Attendance
Present:
- Brett
- Sirisha
- Michael

- Darren

## Meeting
Brett: Based on the last couple lectures, feels like the team has fallen a little bit behind. Team leads are responsible for that, should have been more diligent in assigning clear tasks for everyone to complete instead of just generally listing out what needed to be done. From now on, the leads will be better about assigning specific tasks for each role-group to complete so we can stay on track with the project.
