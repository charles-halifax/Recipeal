## Context and Problem Statement

We need to figure out how we will go about working on the styling for our app. What is the best option for us?

## Considered Options

* Bootstrap
* Plain 'ol CSS

## Decision Outcome

Chosen option: "Bootstrap + by hand", because 

* Even though only one of us was familiar with it, it's very easy to pick up and learn
* It is very versatile and comes with many built in icons
* Reduces the amount of CSS we have to write by hand
